# bgg
this repository is for various projects making use of data from boardgamegeek.com.

this project is ongoing, but will be steadily updated (and reorganized) as I continue to work on various projects with BGG data.

for the code I use in my work, see the RMarkdown notebooks.

for the output of the work in CSV format, see the folders containing data, which will be CSV files with the date most recently added.

historical data from: https://github.com/beefsack/bgg-ranking-historicals
